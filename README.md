# Polynom_Ex1
this project is about monoms and polynoms with some function like computing and drawing etc...., and this is some informtion about the functions.

Monom Functions: Represents Mathematical Monom in Object Oriented programming in the form of ax^b.

Polynom Functions: Represents Mathematical Polynom in Object Oriented programming in the form of a_1X^b_1 + a_2X^b_2 ... a_nXb_n, which is consisted of ArrayList collection of Monoms.

complex function: Represents Mathematical Complex Function in the form of operations that calculate the certain function in order.

FunctionGUI: This class is able to representing a collection of functions that can be saved to a file, be read from a file, and displayed in GUI form using STDDraw.
